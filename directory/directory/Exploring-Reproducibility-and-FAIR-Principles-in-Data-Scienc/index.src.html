<p>Reproducibility is a fundamental requirement of the scientific process since it enables outcomes to be replicated and verified. Computational scientific experiments can benefit from improved reproducibility for many reasons, including validation of results and reuse by other scientists. However, designing reproducible experiments remains a challenge and hence the need for developing methodologies and tools that can support this process. Here, we propose a conceptual model for reproducibility to specify its main attributes and properties, along with a framework that allows for computational experiments to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. We present a case study in ecological niche modeling to demonstrate and evaluate the implementation of this framework.</p>
