<p>The pressures of a scientific career can end up incentivising an all‐or‐nothing approach to cross the finish line first. While competition can be healthy and drives innovation, the current system fails to encourage scientists to work reproducibility. This sometimes leaves those individuals who come second to correct mistakes in published research without being rewarded. Instead, we need a culture that rewards reproducibility and holds it as important as the novelty of the result. Here, I draw on my own journey in the oestrogen receptor research field to highlight this and suggest ways for the 'first past the post' culture to be challenged.</p>
