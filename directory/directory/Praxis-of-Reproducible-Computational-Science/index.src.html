<p>Among the top challenges of reproducible computational science are the following: 1) creation, curation, usage, and publication of research software; 2) acceptance, adoption, and standardization of open-science practices; and 3) misalignment with academic incentive structures and institutional processes for career progression. I will mainly address the first two here, proposing a praxis of reproducible computational science.</p>
